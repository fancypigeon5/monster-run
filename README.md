## Strategy
Monster Run is designed to motivate individuals to start or maintain their running routines. Players can create and battle monsters, earning points by entering their running data to unlock new equipment or recover health points lost during battles. The game features a leaderboard to compare monsters and track points.

The project aims to demonstrate proficiency in the Django framework by showcasing an understanding of database models and delivering a fully functional web application that highlights both front-end and back-end capabilities.
