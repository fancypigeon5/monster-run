## Strategy
Monster Run is designed to motivate individuals to start or maintain their running routines. Players can create and battle monsters, earning points by entering their running data to unlock new equipment or recover health points lost during battles. The game features a leaderboard to compare monsters and track points.

The project aims to demonstrate proficiency in the Django framework by showcasing an understanding of database models and delivering a fully functional web application that highlights both front-end and back-end capabilities.

## Database structure

In order to help navigating the database I created this database model. It shows the different tables in the database and their relation to eachother.

![Database structure](images/database-structure.png)

## Testing

### Tests

- __All the tests can be found in [this file](manual-testing.md).__

### Validators

I used the W3 validator for both HTML and CSS and JSHint for the javascript.

#### HTML:
##### Monster page:
the validator found two issues:
- since the images are svg's when having multiple of the same type the ID's in the svg occur multiple times.

##### Create monster page:
the validator found one issue:
- maxlength attribute is not allowed on input type color, this was created by the django form.

##### Equipment page:
the validator found Three issues:
- since the images are svg's when having multiple of the same type the ID's in the svg occur multiple times.
- tr, th, td tags made by django forms require a table element (This is a Django problem).

##### Run data page:
the validator found one issue:
- because there are two forms (max one is shown at any time) the id for the distance input occurs twice in the html (django forms gives this id).

##### Arena page:
the validator found no issues.

##### Scoreboard page:
the validator found two issues:
- since the images are svg's when having multiple of the same type the ID's in the svg occur multiple times.

##### Battleground page:
the validator found two issues:
- Since the images are svg's when having multiple of the same type the ID's in the svg occur multiple times.


#### CSS:
The validator found no issues.

#### JS:
The validator found no issues.

### Compatibility

- I tested the site on several different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari) and did not notice any problems on Different browsers.

### Responsiveness

- I tested the site on a number of different screen sizes ranging from very small screens e.g. iPhone 5 (320px wide) to very large screens e.g. 5K iMac Pro (5120 x 2880 px).

## Deployment

### How the page is deployed

1. **Log In to Heroku**
   - Go to the [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) and log in to view your installed apps.

2. **Create a New App**
   - Click on **New** and select **Create new app**.
   - Choose a unique name for your application and select your region.
   - Click on **Create app**.

3. **Set Up Database**
   - After creating your app, navigate to your [database host](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net) (in this case the code institute PostgreSQL).
   - Set up your database and make sure to get the **Database URL**.

4. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Go to the **Settings** tab and click on **Reveal Config Vars**.
   - Add `DATABASE_URL` to Config Vars with your database url as its value.

5. **Create Environment File**
   - In your local environment, create a new file named `env.py` in the top-level directory.
   - Add `env.py` to your gitignore file.
   - In `env.py`, set your environment variables:
     ```python
     import os
     os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "Paste in DATABASE_URL Link"
     os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "Make up your own randomSecretKey"
     ```

6. **Add Secret Key to Heroku**
   - In Heroku, go to the **Settings** tab and click on **Reveal Config Vars**.
   - Add `SECRET_KEY` to Config Vars with the value you previously generated.

7. **Update `settings.py`**
   - Remove the insecure secret key and replace it with:
     ```python
     SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
     ```
   - Update your database settings to use the `DATABASE_URL`:
     ```python
     import dj_database_url
     DATABASES = {
         'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
     }
     ```
   - Add `https://*.herokuapp.com` to CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS and ALLOWED_HOSTS

8. **Run Migrations**
   - Save all changes and run migrations using:
     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

9. **Set Up Static Files with WhiteNoise**
   - To serve your static files without relying on external services, use the Python package **WhiteNoise**.
   - **Install and set up the package**:
     ```bash
     pip3 install whitenoise~=5.3.0
     pip3 install whitenoise
     ```
   - **Add the package to your `requirements.txt` file**:
     ```bash
     pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
     pip3 freeze whitenoise
     ```
   - **Wire up WhiteNoise to Django's `MIDDLEWARE` in `settings.py`**:
     - Note: The WhiteNoise middleware must be placed directly after the Django SecurityMiddleware.
     ```python
     MIDDLEWARE = [
         'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
         'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
         # other middleware...
     ]
     ```

10. **Create a Procfile**
    - In the top-level directory, create a file named `Procfile`.
    - Add the following line with your project name:
      ```plaintext
      web: gunicorn [PROJECT_NAME].wsgi
      ```

11. **Push Changes to Heroku**
    - In the terminal, run the following commands to add, commit, and push your changes:
      ```bash
      git add .
      git commit -m "Deploying to Heroku"
      git push heroku main
      ```

12. **Deploy Your App**
